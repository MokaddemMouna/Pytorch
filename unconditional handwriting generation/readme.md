This is an attempt to implement a simplified version of Grave's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850) for unconditional handwriting generation.
Besides the original paper,the following links helped me to better understand the model and the implementation:
* Otoro's [blog](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/11/24/mixture-density-networks-with-tensorflow/) for density mixture network
* Otoro's [blog](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/12/handwriting-generation-demo-in-tensorflow/) for the rnn model for handwriting generation
* Explanation and pytorch implementation blog following Ottoro's aforementioned blogs, github [repo](https://gist.github.com/lirnli/fc7cf6235ef1a0343321af6f1be01702)
